# ProfileCreation

Notes:
I deviated from the listed requirements by having an indicator for required fields, having a hide/display icon for the password field, and showing an icon if the email or website value is invalid. These are beneficial to an end user because it lets them know the following:
- what fields they need to fill out
- what fields have incorrect values - this lets them know why the "submit" button is disabled
- having the hide/display icon for the password field lets the user double check their password before creating their account


Note: This is my first attempt at using SwiftUI. I currently use UIKit at my current job.
